            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This ſad ſpectacle here before us, is Death's <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to all fleſh, and by preaching J may aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment its expreſſion; and truly this is one end of three
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119062:6"/>of this ſo ſolemn a meeting in the houſe of God; Whereof,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The First,</hi> is to difference the bodies of Saints from thoſe of beaſts and ſuch as are worſe than beaſts, which without reſpect are drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of our Cities, as was that of <hi>Jehoiakim, Jer.</hi> 22.19.</p>
            <p>The bleſsed incarnation of Chriſt may be ſufficient to re-minde us of ſome diſcriminative reſpect even to the bodies of his ſervants, after their ſouls have made their retreat into the boſome of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and for this ſo laudable a cuſtome, we have an authentick example in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.1. where we finde that <hi>Samuel</hi> dyed, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Second,</hi> is to repreſent the Virtues of the deceas'd to the view of others for imitation.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. i: 26 2 Chron: 35:</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> commended <hi>Jonathan</hi> for his more than foeminine affection; The holy Ghoſt King <hi>Joſiah</hi> for his integrity; St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the Patriarchs and Prophets; and thus our Saviour himſelf commanded, that where ever the goſpel ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, there that which the woman had done to him, ſhould be told for a memorial of her, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13. And therefore (Brethren) if J ſpeak in commendation of this our deceaſed brother, according to his deſert, I do but my duty. The ſoul of a juſt man (after death) lives with God, and 'tis pitie but the virtues of his mind ſhould do ſo too in the memory of men. <hi>Pingitur in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulis formae peritura Venuſtas,

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119062:6"/>and truly I think it as meet to delineate the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſoul, and ſhow it to the world: <hi>Virtus nihil e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubeſcit praeter quam abſcondi:</hi> In the life of a man Virtue is aſham'd of nothing but of being hid, and godly men will ſhow themſelves in the exerciſe of goodneſs; and after their death (when they can no longer ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) 'tis but charity for us to continue their worth in a good report.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Gentleman therefore, I ſhall do both him and you this right, as to ſpeak a little; and with the number of his Virtues I ſhall not rank his deſcent and parentage, though I finde nobility of birth to be a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al jewel in the diadem of a Prince, in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed art thou (O Land) when thy King is the ſon of Nebles:</hi> For though his Progenitors were Gentlemen &amp; Knights of great quality; yet I am not making an Oration in a Hall, but a Sermon in a Church, where nothing but matters divine and of edification to the precious ſoul, are ſeaſonable and comely. In order whereunto, let me propoſe (for example) the ſobriety, righteouſneſs and godlineſs of this deceaſed Gentleman; thoſe three Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which (like ſo many ſtars of higheſt magnitude) the grace of <hi>God</hi> fixeth in the firmament of the Saints converſation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.

'Tis reported of old <hi>Parr</hi> (who was 152. yeers of age) that uſing but mean and moderate dyet in the Countrey, he kept himſelf in health; but coming up to the Court at London, the dainties which he was tempted to at the <hi>Kings</hi> table, ſoon overthrew his body.</p>
            <p>But this our deceaſed friend was once requeſted &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with, to go to London; where his friends thought their eyes bleſs'd in ſo venerable a piece of antiquitie; and to gratifie the favour of his ſociety, they tender'd to his acceptance all thoſe varieties which that citie could afford: But he being then (as formerly) tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things, ſo reſiſted the temptation of exceſs, as he returned into the countrey in perfect health. If ever therefore my Brethren, you deſire to ſee many days, and that your bodies may be in a ſweet ſubſerviency to your ſouls, and your ſouls to God, live as this our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friend did, ſoberly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he lived righteouſly, or juſtly, as to his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with men; he dealt well with himſelf by living ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and well with others by living righteouſly: He paid thoſe twofold debts which all men (eſpecially Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) are concern'd in. 1. Debts of Juſtice according to the Apoſtles rule in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. where he ſayes, <hi>Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute, cuſtome to whom cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor;</hi> and thus did he, and that not for
<note place="margin">† Rom. 13.5.</note> wrath, but for conſcience ſake. 2. He paid his debts of charity and mercy, which J call
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119062:7"/>debts, becauſe J finde the Apoſtle does in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. and therefore the diſcharging thereof is the true badge and cognizance of a Chriſtian, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.35 &amp; <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p>To ſatisfie debts of Juſtice, men are taught (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the fear of God is) by men, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29.13. and hereunto they may be conſtrained by the dint of the law of a Common-weal; but to love one another, men are taught of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.9. which (being a duty not onely in deed and word, but extending it ſelf to a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table heart) is onely found in the ſpiritual law of Chriſt; he therefore is the onely true Diſciple of Chriſt, who loves as in the ſight of God, (who is the ſearcher of the heart) and whoſe ſoul melts with a tender compaſſion towards all men, eſpecially towards the
<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 6. io.</note> houſhold of faith, and ſuch as beare about them the marks of the Lord Jeſus: And thus did our friend, who did not ſo much poure forth his charity out of his purſe, as out of the bowels of mercy; not ſo much out of the hand as heart; as much of this temper J am ſure, appeared by the diſtribution of his eſtate, which he gave not to ſuch as were already furniſhed with a plenty, as commonly men do, with purpoſe onely to tranſmit an airie name to poſterity; but to ſuch as he thought might ſtand in ſome need; and thus he alwayes deſir'd that his eſtate might be rather ſupplemental than ornamental.</p>
            <p>And now Brethren, as in time of his life his hand was alwayes open to give to the poor; ſo he lent the Lord, and the Lord (who is a debtor to no man) return'd him what he gave in a manifold bleſſing; God bleſſed him as he did
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.1.</note>

As for his love, he did firſt pitch it upon God, and then upon man for Gods ſake, and upon ſuch eſpecially as did neareſt communicate as he thought of the likeneſs of God. He was tender in point of cenſuring others, whoſe judgment differ'd in matters rather of the ſuperſtructure, than the foundation of faith; or in matters intricate and of controverſie, and not oppoſing an holy life: Difference in judgement in ſuch affairs, ſhould not with him make a breach of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, eſpecially if the parties ſo erring were conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their outward converſation, &amp; ſeemed deſirous to prove all things, and hold faſt that which was good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles rule, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.

When between the Miniſters of Lynn there was a difference about the extent of divine grace, he carried himſelf with an amiable wiſdome and circumſpection; for he became an Auditor to both parties, accounting that whatſoever was propounded in the name of God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, might well deſerve audience; and when he had well weighed their opinions, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that God had a peculiar people whom he knew from the beginning of the world, and into whoſe hearts he purpoſed (by his determinate counſell) ſo to put his fear that they ſhould not depart from him, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. yet ſo as not to lay any violent conſtraint upon the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their wills, but to make them willing in the day of his power in the beauties of holineſs, and to draw them with a certain omnipotent facilitie, who otherwiſe through natural corruption would never become ſubject to the divine will. When once he and I had diſcourſe concerning the Univerſaliſts, I told him, that the ſacred Trinitie of Perſons, the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, as they had a

Luke 1.51</note> finger in the creation of man, and of the whole fabrick of heaven and earth, ſo they had an arm in the redemption of man, and were all equally ſharers therein; 'twas the Fathers good pleaſure to ſend the Son into humane fleſh; and the Son's good pleaſure to take it upon him to work ſalvation for men; and the Holy Ghoſt's pleaſure to work that ſalvation in them which the Son works for them; ſo that unleſs the ſun of righteouſneſs did ariſe upon the hearts of men by the healing power of his ſpirit, neither could they diſcern,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119062:9"/>nor would they imbrace the way of their eternal peace; and becauſe this gracious work of Gods ſpirit is found in ſome and not in others, we therefore ſay, <hi>God</hi> loves ſome more then he does others, and though many bee call'd, yet few are choſen; &amp; that there ſhould be any one (I told him) 'twas the infinite free mercy of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and this he certainly did believe; and was not this faith of his like that of <hi>Abraham?</hi> yes verily, in this hee was a true ſon of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and therefore as <hi>God</hi> was to <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſhield, and an exceeding great reward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. ſo he was and is to him; he was a ſhield to defend him from the fiery darts of Satan, and to keep him ſafe from the dominion and condemnation of ſin, and he is now (queſtionleſs) his exceeding great reward, giving him a crown of righteouſneſs in his glorious and eternal kingdome, where we will leave him to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his working, and betake our ſelves to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of our reward, who are yet but labourers in the Vinyard here below, or rather ſtrangers in this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, and ſojourners, as all our fathers were; whereof to have a more firm and active remembrance, is</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> (before he dyed) was an old man, a good old man and full of yeers; the words are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, but a full narrative of <hi>Abraham's</hi> life; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:119062:9"/>was a great man in yeers, and he was as good as great, and therefore was ſaid to have dyed in a good old age; they which liv'd before him, liv'd much longer, even above eight hundred yeers; yet we read not that they dyed in a good old age, and they which liv'd after him, liv'd not ſo long; ſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> was remarkable in yeers, and as much in goodneſs; <hi>God</hi> made him great in yeers, and his grace crown'd his yeers with goodneſs: From whence therefore we may draw a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold obſervation.</p>

Now as in other gifts of God, ſo in this, God has a further intendment of grace to all his people; when the Lord reaches forth his hand in any gift of his, he does it to draw a man to himſelf in the knowledge of, and ſweet communion with him: The Lord
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.1.</note> labours for the advantage of men, both in his word and works; and thus he does in the gift of a long life: The Lord in his Sabbaths, intends a peculiar ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration of our ſelves unto his divine ſervice, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that thereby we ſhould ſymbolize or betoken the God of our creation or redemption, but that we ſhould benefit our ſelves in a fuller knowledge of God, and the way of ſalvation; for, to that purpoſe the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27.

And ſo much as we ſee of the goodneſs of the Lord, in the length of our dayes, ſo much we ought the more to be led to repentance, and to do good; length of dayes are a talent from the Lord, which he puts into our hands to improve, and not to lay up in a napkin, nor yet to drive away, as ſome (by vain and unprofitable ſports) do their time: There ſhould be

            </p>
            <p>And now (my brethren) ſince this is a truth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, out of the bleſsed word of God, and by confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all ſides, it may be matter of
<list>
                  <item>Firſt comfort to ſome.</item>
                  <item>Secondly reprehenſion to others.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly inſtruction to all.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, this may be comfort, Firſt to ſuch, whoſe deareſt friends &amp; relations are dead in the Lord, as this our friend doubtleſs is; ſuch as they, are not <hi>amiſſi,</hi> onely <hi>praemiſſi,</hi> not loſt or utterly periſh'd, but ſent before us thither, whether (the Lord grant) we may follow; for they have exchanged a <hi>Hadadrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> or valley of tears, for a glorious ſeat of pleaſures at the right hand of God for evermore; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. they have only left of ſerving the Lord at a diſtance, and are gone to waite on him at his own court.</p>
            <p>Secondly, comfort to ſuch who for conſcience ſake are under the hands of implacable perſecutors, who can but kill the
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> body, and are not able to kill the ſoul and if their bodies only ſuffer which ſuffer for an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they may be killed; but not hurt, as a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> once ſaid of a Tyrant, <hi>occidere poteſt, laedere vero non,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seneca</note> he may kill me, but he cannot hurt me. <hi>Julian</hi> that bloody Apoſtate in ſlaughtering the Chriſtians, pretended, that if they looked upon their condition as ſo good after death, he did them no wrong to ſend them the ſooner away; and truly, no more hedid not; for he did but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119062:19"/>ſend them away from ſuch incarnate Devills as he was, unto a glorious company in heaven; they were but ground with the teeth of ſuch furious beaſts, the better to make bread for Angels, as ſaint <hi>Jgnatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, comfort to ſuch who with the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.10. have ſpent their life with grief, and their years with ſighing for their ſins, and who have walked ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, and have been painfull and faithful labourers in the Lords Vineyard, having born the heat of many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious dayes in the ſervice of God; let them know, that (when they dye) their hope is not at an end; for if it ſhould be, the moſt precious Saints of God, of all men would be the moſt miſerable, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. No certainly, they have not their pains only for their labour (as we uſe to ſay) but if they ſowe in tears, they ſhall reap in joy; if they go forth weeping and bear in their hearts the precious ſeed of Gods holy word, they ſhall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs return with rejoyceing, they ſhall return with the ſheaves of their ſouls ſo laden with much grain of grace, as ſhall render them only fit to be layd up in the Barne of heaven, and there they ſhall be and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves for ever with the joy of their Maſter <hi>Math.</hi> 25.21.</p>
            <p>Secondly this may be matter of reprehenſion to others, and to thoſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, who are Atheiſts in Judgement, and Epicures in practice, who ſay in their hearts, (like fooles) there is no God, and live as if there were neither heaven nor hell; there are ſome who think if they be but half good in this life, they ſhall be made up perfect in purgatory; there are others who care not to be good at all, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that as they live like beaſts, ſo they ſhall totally periſh like beaſts, <hi>&amp; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:119062:19"/>all places now a dayes are full of ſuch fooles; and ſome having wickedly armed their fancies with a few ends of Poetry, and a little of the out ſide of Philoſophy, go go too and fro like the Devil himſelf, ſeeking whom they may devour into ſuch blind and pernicious perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but if ſuch men would but look into the Parable of the rich man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they might ſoon ſpie out the immortality of the ſoul, nay, if ſuch men would but con over their own Bible (for ſo I call their bookes of Poetry) a little more ingenuouſly, they would find that <hi>Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis,</hi> when ever ſuch as they are dye, the Devil is ready to receive their ſouls.</p>
            <p>This may be matter of reprehenſion to all earthly muck-wormes, who by endeavouring with ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anxious care to feather their own neſts, acknowledge nothing more than that felicity confines it ſelf within the limits of this tranſitory world; otherwiſe why ſhould old men oftentimes (who have one foot alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the grave) lay out the choyce of their thoughts and affections that way; 'tis indeed a wonder, and that to the more ingenuous ſort of heathen, as <hi>Tully. Poteſt enim quicquam eſſe abſurdius,

                  </gap>us vitae reſtat, eo plus viatici quaereres</hi> can there be any thing more abſurd than when a man hath traveled out the journey of his life almoſt to an end, that then he ſhould lay in greateſt proviſion for the way? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſuch men in all their gatherings remember not that their ſouls ſhall be gathered unto another life after this, either unto a life in hell, or a life in heaven, which life onely deſerves the name of life, for in that of hell the ſoul is in perpetuall dying: Oh therefore how does it concern men rather to lay up in ſtore ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith, as that when they come (through
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119062:20"/>death) to let go their hold of this vain and empty world, they may lay hold on eternall life, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. hence then, this may be in the next place matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, then ſince there is a certain day of death for all men, as well for the friends of God as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 41.8. as for his greateſt enemies; ſince no man can redeem his life from the hand of the grave, and that after this life is ended, another wil certainly follow, &amp; as we fall in death, ſo we ſhall lye to all eternity; let us gird up the loines of our minds and fit our ſelves for our Chriſtian race, and in it be alwayes looking at the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Author and finiſher of our faith; lets have a care of making all the
<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 18 10.</note> haſte we can, into the ſtrong tower of his great name; lets be careful that we deſire him here as a Chriſt, for grace &amp; Government in his ſervice, that at the great and terrible day of the Lord we may have him to be a Jeſus, to ſhelter us from the fire of Gods anger: 'Tis certain the Lord hatl.
<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17, 31</note> appointed a day to judge the world in; and therefore lets remember that of <hi>St. Cyprian, Qualem te invenit Deus cum de hoc mundo evocat,
<note place="margin">In Ser. de Mer.</note> talem pariter &amp; Judicat,</hi> as death leaves thee, ſo judgement will find thee; and if thou beeſt an aged man and dyeſt in thy ſins, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wilt thou be able to make to God for ſo many dayes miſpent? what wilt thou think, when thou ſhalt peep out of thy grave and ſee all the world in a flame about thy eares? Will not the noiſe of the laſt Trump ſtrike thee into horror and amazement to think, that then thou muſt be hailed before the Tribunal of Chriſt, to give an account of that talent of thy ſoul, which he hath put into thy hands, to uſe to his glory, and ſhalt have nothing to ſay why the terrible curſe ſhould not be executed upon thee? Wilt thou not then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119062:20"/>rather wiſh, that (with <hi>Michaiah</hi>) thou had'ſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eaten the bread of affliction, or (with <hi>Eſay</hi>) had'ſt continually gone barefoot, ſo that thereby thou had'ſt gotten intereſt in the Lord Jeſus? Then think upon theſe things in time, you (my deare brethren) that are young, remember your Creator in the dayes of your youth; you that are old, deſpaire not; you are yet alive, and under the call of God to faith; and if you have but faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, you may ſay to the mountaines of your manifold ſins, be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the midſt of the Sea, and they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved ſo far out of the ſight of God, <hi>Micha</hi> 7.19. &amp; this the Lord hath graciouſly promiſed in that immaculate Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſins of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. and therefore 'twill be but juſt for God to forgive ſuch ſins, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. nay he doth not onely allure us to himſelf with the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, but of eternall life in the fruition of his face for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh bleſſed God!</hi> Me thinks then, if there doth remain ſuch a bleſſed reſt for all the people of God, how ſhould we ſtrive to enter in, ſince, when the bodies of Gods Saints ſhall drop to the earth, their ſouls ſhall be carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, &amp; be gathered to the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22.23.</note> to the generall aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, which are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; how ſhould we endeavour to be one of that number? With what violence of devotion ſhould we preſſe forward for the price of the high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. Oh me thinks, what ſhould hinder the manifeſtation of our love to him, (in the oblation of all holy ſacrifices to his name) whom neither iniquity, tranſgreſſion, nor ſin, could
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119062:21"/>conſtrain to deſpiſe the workmanſhip of his hands, but, notwithſtanding our enmitie againſt him by wicked works, he ſhould prepare an habitation for us eternal in the heavens, and not onely ſo, but prepare for us a way thither, a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us, through the vaile, that is to ſay, the fleſh of Chriſt, in whom, whoſoever (whether young or old) approacheth unto the living God. God will in no wiſe caſt out:
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.21</note> Having therefore ſuch an high-prieſt over the houſe of God, let us draw neere with a true heart, in full aſsurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pure water; let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and let us conſider one another to provoke unto love and to good works, not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the day approaching; the day, what day? the day of Judegement, which particularly is after the diſso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſoul and body, but generally is at the end of all the world; which though both dayes are certain, yet becauſe 'tis as uncertain when will be the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it concerns us to make uſe of the preſent time, and whileſt 'tis called to day, be a working out our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, that when the Lord ſhall be pleaſ'd to demand our ſouls, we may freely and with alacrity reſigne them up into his hands, as into the hands of a moſt wiſe mercifull creator and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>And now, what ſhall I ſay more as to the text, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhow you this diſeaſed Gentlemans picture in the words? <hi>Abraham</hi> before he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119062:21"/>dyed, was 175. yeares of Age, our friend was aboue 90. An age that did as kindly ripen him for the Grave as that of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> in regard of which therefore that may be ſaid of him which was ſaid of holy <hi>Job chap.</hi> 5, 26. <hi>That he came to the Grave as a Shocke of Corne cometh in his ſeaſon. Abraham</hi> before he dyed was a good old Man, his goodneſs ſtands upon record in theſe four particulars: Firſt, In his meek and peaceable diſpoſition towards men, as appeared in that he would rather remit of his right than ſtand to contend with his Couſen <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13.9. And this diſpoſition was in our Friend, I know it in one particular my ſelfe: Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledged that of whatſoever he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed God was the Lord, by paying into the hands of his Prieſt his tribute of Tythes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20. And this Reverence to God, the Lord had taught this Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> here departed; He never would dare to rob God of what he claimed as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himſelf, He alwayes made a conſcience of paying that to the Stewards of the myſteries of God, which the Apoſtle cals <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. A reward for the glad tydings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, whether it were by Tythes or otherwiſe. Thirdly <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaw three men at his door in the heat of the day, moſt freindly invited them in, and gave them entertainment, and this was the fruit of his Hoſpitality, that he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Angels unawares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. And this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> was drawn to the life in this his Deceaſed Son, and 'twas known to be in him, whereſoever he was known, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119062:22"/>no queſtion, but by the entertaining the needy members of Chriſt (as frequently he did) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained thoſe three perſons, (which ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Abraham</hi> did) Father Son and holy Ghoſt. But then Fourthly, <hi>Abraham</hi> by the eye of Faith ſaw the day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at almoſt two thouſand yeares diſtance, and ſo did this his Son, in whoſe ſoule ſo firm and lively a Faith was wrought, in Chriſts bleſſed Incarnation, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Seſſion with, and Interceſſion to the Father, that certainly as in the time of his life he thus ſaw Chriſt in part, ſo now he ſees him Face to Face. Now as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that <hi>Abraham</hi> before he dyed was a Good old Man, ſo when he dyed he freely reſigned his Ghoſt to God, aſſuredly knowing that as God promiſed, ſo he would be as good as his word to him in becoming his exceeding great reward; and thus did this his Son, whoſe willingneſs to depart this ſinfull life and to be with God, he delivered to me upon his Death-bed, in many comfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table expreſſions: And thus when <hi>Abraham</hi> had given up the Ghoſt, he was gathered to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even to the ſpirits of thoſe juſt men, who dyed before him, as to his Soul; and to his Wife in the Cave of <hi>Machpelah,</hi> as to his Body: and thus was his Son, we truſt; (as to his Soul) he is beholding the face of God and Chriſt, upon whoſe redundant merits he devolved himſelfe, and as to his body we ſee that he is here brought to his wives (whom he buried here) and to his eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son and Daughters, whoſe Souls together
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119062:22"/>with his (we truſt) are joyned to the Quire of Angels in the glorious and eternall kingdom of God, To which the Lord bring us all through the blood of ſprinkling, Amen.</p>
